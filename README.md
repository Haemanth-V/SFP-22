# SFP-22

This repository contains the codes implemented in Pytorch with an aim to reproduce the results obtained in the paper: "Neural Path Features and Neural Path Kernel: Understanding the role of gates in deep learning" in NeurIPS 2020. A minor modification has also been tried by using linear activations instead of ReLU for the NPF network and it has been found that there is not much loss in the model's performance.
