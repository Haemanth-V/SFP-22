# SFP-22

This repository contains the codes implemented in Pytorch with an aim to reproduce the results obtained in the paper: "Neural Path Features and Neural Path Kernel: Understanding the role of gates in deep learning" in NeurIPS 2020. A minor modification has also been tried by using linear activations instead of ReLU for the NPF network and it has been found that there is not much loss in the model's performance.  The table below summarizes the experiments carried out and the results obtained i comparison to the results published in the paper.
